============

Going to track info about Foundation

Using HTML, CSS, jQuery and cTwitter, build an application that does the following:

1) It tracks some technology-related term(s) that are being commonly used.


2) It displays at most 10 tweets at a time (after the 10 most recent tweets are displayed, the earliest tweets start to disappear to make room for the new tweets)

3) It must use jQuery's fadeOut/fadeIn or slideDown/slideUp methods in some way.

When you're finished, post a link to your Github repository here.
